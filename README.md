# Pymaceuticals_Matplotlib_Challenge

Observations:
1. Capomulin and Ramicane were the only drugs effective at shrinking tumor volume.
2. While Capomulin and Ramicane did slow the spread of the cancer, none of the drugs were completely effective at stopping spread of the cancer (Metastatic Sites).
3. Capomulin and Ramicane had the highest effectiveness at keeping mice alive however all populations suffered declining survival rates throughout the entire testing period.
4. Only Capomulin and Ramicane were effective at shrinking tumors.
